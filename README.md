# College Hostel Booking System

## Overview

The **College Hostel Booking System** is a Python-based console application developed to simplify hostel room allocation and booking management. It provides an organized and user-friendly solution for managing hostel accommodations within educational institutions.

The system enables students to view available rooms, reserve hostel accommodation, cancel existing bookings, and search booking details using room numbers. Administrators can monitor room occupancy, view complete room information, and generate room usage statistics for better hostel management.

Room information is maintained using Python dictionaries, where each room contains its type and current occupancy status. Student booking details such as booking ID, student name, register number, department, year, and mobile number are stored dynamically during program execution.

The application follows a menu-driven design and demonstrates core Python programming concepts including functions, dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, input validation, random number generation, modular programming, and data management.

Although the current implementation stores data temporarily in memory, it provides a strong foundation for future enhancements such as database integration, online hostel booking, authentication, payment processing, email notifications, and web-based management systems.

## Working Principle

The application initializes a predefined list of hostel rooms. Each room has a room number, room type, and availability status.

Users can perform different operations through a menu-driven interface. When a room is booked, student details are collected, a unique booking ID is generated, and the room status changes from **Available** to **Occupied**.

If a booking is cancelled, the room becomes available again. Administrators can monitor all rooms and occupancy details, while the statistics module displays the total number of rooms, available rooms, and occupied rooms.
